 # tails 

tails is a cute little assistant which you can play around with and get help from!  
built in python with love :3  
  
### how to run  
you can find executables for windows in releases tab!!  (linux isn't currently supported as tails uses OS-specific libs, currently working on support for linux)
  
OR, if you're running source code,  
you'll need to install, PyQt5 (graphics :3) and pynput (listening to mouse :3):  
`pip install PyQt5 pynput`  
and then run `main.py`!  
    
### how to interact  
tails has a builtin routine system, so it'll automatically keep him active,  
you can also **right-click** on him to get him to sit, stand or fly,  
you can again, **right-click** somewhere on the screen, he'll either fly or walk there.
i'll be adding chatting soon so you can make him an assistant. 

### future plan
- add more actions and animations
- add chatting, (LLMs obviously, probably gemini or chat gippity)
- add mobile support :3

### current issues
