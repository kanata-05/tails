 # tails 

tails is a cute little assistant which you can play around with and get help from!
built in python with love :3

### future plan
- add more actions and animations
- add chatting, (LLMs obviously, probably gemini or chat gippity)
- add mobile support :3

### current issues
- snaps back to ground randomly while flying 
- right-click menu doesn't work except the fly and exit buttons
- stays in walking animation when it should be idle
- i did a bad job cropping the sprites so they vibrate alot

### credits
all tails sprites have been taken from teamhedgehog,
credits goes to: cylenite, riokenn, danielsydney, dave(hypero)edwards

all code is mine :3
