 # tails 

tails is a cute little assistant which you can play around with and get help from!  
built in python with love :3  
  
### how to run  
you need to install, PyQt5 (graphics :3) and pynput (listening to mouse :3):  
`pip install PyQt5 pynput`  
    
# how to interact  
tails has a builtin routine system, so it'll automatically keep him active,  
you can also right-click on him to get him to sit, stand or fly,  
you can again, right-click somewhere on the screen, he'll either fly or walk there.
i'll be adding chatting soon so you can make him an assistant. 

### future plan
- add more actions and animations
- add chatting, (LLMs obviously, probably gemini or chat gippity)
- add mobile support :3

### current issues
- snaps back to ground randomly while flying
